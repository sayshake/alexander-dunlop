                        We are in an era of marketing where what the product or service does is less important than what it means to people. Iconic brands acquire cultural meaning through having a distinct personality. They have a story to tell, and the ability to create a world in which people want to immerse themselves.

                       We work with global brand teams on a collaborative journey of discovery informed by an analysis of the brand, the category, and their place in the culture. Several promising archetypal characters will be introduced into the mix to stimulate creative thinking. The outcome of all this will serve as a foundation from which to build all other aspects of a coherent brand meaning system.

                        This journey delivers a secure rock on which the brand's meaning system is based. It is more reliable than a definition based on concepts, words, and a set of adjectives – and one that is more transferable across cultures.

                                Quantitative studies will tell you what is or isn't working in your communications, but it won't necessarily tell you why. Standard qualitative studies put several people from one culture in a room where there is so much that they don't need to talk about because it is culturally shared, and therefore taken for granted. (Like the fish above, they can't see culture.
